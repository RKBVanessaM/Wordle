- Created the start page for the WORDLE project.
- Added a welcoming message and two buttons: "Yes" (to start the game) and "No" (to exit).
- The "Yes" button redirects to p2.html (the game page), and the "No" button redirects to p3.html (exit page).

- Merged the rules box (with open/close functionality) and the WORDLE game grid.
- Added a rules section that can be shown or hidden using an "X" icon and a "Rules" button.
- Implemented a WORDLE grid with 6 rows and 5 input boxes per row.
- Added an on-screen keyboard below the grid, including letter buttons, a delete button, and an enter button.
- Only the first row can be interracted with at the start, the rest of the rows unlock after entering a valid 5-letter word.
- The valid words are stored in the "text" variable and the secret word is randomly selected from it.
- When a word is entered and "ENTER" is pressed:
  - The word is checked against the valid words list.
  - Each letter in the guess is colored:
    - Green if the letter is in the correct position.
    - Orange if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
    - Gray if the letter is not in the word.
  - The keyboard buttons also update their colors to match the status of each letter.
  - If the guess matches the secret word, all boxes turn green and the player is redirected to p4.html, where a congratulatory message is shown, and the player chooses if they want to play again.
  - If the guess is incorrect and rows remain, the next row is enabled for another attempt.
  - If all rows are used, the player is redirected to p5.html, where the can choose if the want to play again.
- Direct typing in the input boxes is disabled, input is only possible via the on-screen keyboard.
